          <p>Fifth-year mathematics and theoretical physics student at the University of St Andrews.</p>
          <p>Through work experience and internships at the Humboldt University of Berlin, CERN, the Institute of Physics and DuPont I have gained first-hand knowledge of how the physics learned in the classroom is applied to real-world problems. I enjoy modelling physics and mathematics problems using Python, Fortran and the Wolfram Language as well as developing data science and machine learning skills.</p>
          <p>I am the web editor for a scientific organisation, and I produce a science podcast for the University of St Andrews Physics Society. Also, I enjoy using PHP along with SQL to create web applications, and I have A-levels in Physics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Music as well as an AS in Chemistry.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Spent three months during summer 2017 working on a project involving using a convolutional neural network to detect, from videos, fish swimming on the surface of sulfur water.</li>
          <li>Wrote a program that takes the fish detected by the neural network and connects the fish across frames in the video. It then filters out poor quality detections by setting a minimum number of frames a chain of detections has to be present in before it is considered to be a fish.</li>
          <li>My program significantly improved the reliability of the output from the neural network. This was proven by comparing the filtered detections with the detections from the neural network using annotated ground truth frames.</li>
          <li>I also read about neural networks and retrained the existing neural network with new training data and different training parameters. I created multiple models then analysed their accuracy to find the optimal parameters.</li>
          <li>Used BASH extensively throughout to work with files and run programs on the computer. Created scripts to automate many tasks. Developed my skills using Vim.</li>
          <li>More details regarding the structure of the program are available on LinkedIn.</li>

          <li>Adapted my schedule when old projects changed and when new projects started.</li>
          <li>Built responsive website with member and events management system using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and iCalander as well as Slack and Mailchimp integrations to allow the committee to manage the society better. Used Google Analytics to monitor traffic and assess effectiveness of website content. Made adjustments accordingly.</li>
          <li>Co-founded and produced a science podcast, managing the technical aspects including the website, radio station, emails, RSS feed and editing and mastering the raw audio. Analysed email and website click-through rates to boost listening figures. I personally interviewed guests on occasions.</li>
          <li>Assisted with funding applications by recommending new podcasting equipment as well as participating in interviews for society awards. The society won 2nd most innovative society in St Andrews in 2017 primarily for the podcast.</li>
          <li>Implemented new advertising strategies including advertising through a Snapchat Geofilter and digital displays. Improved the society's social media presence by migrating to a Facebook Page.</li>
