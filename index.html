I'm Conor MacBride, a data scientist based in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

In my free time I contribute to open source projects, including [SunPy](https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy) and [Astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy).
While my effort primarily involves Python development, I also work on integrating DevOps into open source projects to increase the quality of software and make it easier for new contributors to get involved.
I achieve this by developing and maintaining Matplotlib's [`pytest-mpl`](https://github.com/matplotlib/pytest-mpl) plugin and [CI/CD pipeline templates](https://github.com/OpenAstronomy), as well as working with open source projects [directly](https://sunpy.org/project/roles#continuous-integration-maintainer).

I obtained a PhD in astrophysics from Queen's University Belfast in 2023, which involved studying waves in the Sun's atmosphere using numerical simulations.
Prior to that, I obtained an MPhys Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (first-class honours) from the University of St Andrews in 2019.
During my time at St Andrews, I co-founded an award-winning science podcast, [insight](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~physoc1/insight/).
