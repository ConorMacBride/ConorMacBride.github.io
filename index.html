MPhys Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (first-class honours) graduate of the University of St Andrews. Currently undertaking a Physics PhD at Queen's University Belfast, specialising in solar physics.

Through work experience and internships at the University of St Andrews, Humboldt University of Berlin, CERN, the Institute of Physics and more, I have gained first-hand knowledge of how the physics learned in the classroom is applied to real-world problems. I enjoy modelling physics and mathematics problems using Python, Fortran and the Wolfram Language as well as developing data science and machine learning skills.

I am the web editor for a scientific organisation, and during my time at St Andrews, I co-founded an award-winning science podcast. I enjoy configuring Linux systems as well as building websites. I have A-levels in Physics, Mathematics, Further Mathematics and Music as well as an AS in Chemistry.
