  I’m Conor MacBride, a data scientist based in Belfast, Northern Ireland. In
  my free time I contribute to open source projects. I obtained a PhD in
  astrophysics from Queen’s University Belfast in 2023, which involved studying
  waves in the Sun’s atmosphere using numerical simulations. Prior to that, I
  obtained an MPhys Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (first-class honours)
  from the University of St Andrews in 2019.
