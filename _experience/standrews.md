- I spent six weeks working in the Solar and Magnetospheric Theory group within the School of Mathematics and Statistics under the supervision of Prof. Alan Hood.
- My research project involved exploring the magnetohydrodynamics equations in the context of the Sun, investigating how a magnetic field behaves in the presence of a non-constant Alfv&eacute;n speed, which introduces the process of phase mixing.
