- Worked closely with other committee members to boost attendance at events. Anticipated their needs and took initiative, designing and distributing posters and other media prior to events.
- Adapted my schedule when old projects changed and when new projects started.
- Built responsive website with member and events management system using HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL and iCalendar as well as Slack and Mailchimp integrations to allow the committee to manage the society better. Used Google Analytics to monitor traffic and assess effectiveness of website content. Made adjustments accordingly.
