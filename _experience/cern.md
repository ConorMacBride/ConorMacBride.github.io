- Spent a week visiting sites and attending lectures and meetings. Got to experience what it involves to be a physicist by shadowing the head of operations in the beams department as well as his colleagues.
- Collected data on the chromaticity and horizontal and vertical tune while controlling a beam cycle in the proton synchrotron by manipulating currents in various magnets. Developed my problem solving skills while first cleaning then analysing this dataset using Mathematica.
- Developed my listening skills when attending meetings and listening to explanations which I was required to act upon.
